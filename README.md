# Simple Forums

This will be a simple forum software built on CodeIgniter 4. It is as much a demo project as it is a tool
that I wanted for use on a couple of sites. It is being modelled after more minimal/modern forum software
like [NodeBB](https://community.nodebb.org/), the [site Statamic built](https://lodge.statamic.com/), 
and the like.

It is just getting started, so please don't use, yet.
